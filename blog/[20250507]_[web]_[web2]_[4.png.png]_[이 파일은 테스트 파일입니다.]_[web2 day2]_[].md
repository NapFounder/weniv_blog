## 1. Understanding HTML Elements
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

An example like ```<h1>Paragraph 1</h1>``` is  an HTML element.

```<h1> and </h1>``` are the HTML tags.

"Paragraph 1" is the element content.

The ```<h1>``` tag defines a heading on a website.

We can see that it uses angle brackets (<, >).

The first part is called the opening tag, and the second is the closing tag.
