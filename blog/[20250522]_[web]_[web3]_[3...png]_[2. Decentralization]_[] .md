## 1. What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and How Does It Work?
DeFi is an emerging peer-to-peer financial system that enables entities to transact directly with each other. 

The key principle behind DeFi is to remove third parties like banks from the financial system, thereby reducing costs and transaction time.

DeFi challenges this centralized financial (banking) system by empowering individuals with peer-to-peer transactions.
