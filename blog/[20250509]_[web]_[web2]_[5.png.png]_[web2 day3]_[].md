## 1. CSS Color
1. Predefined color (ex. gray, darkgray ..)
2. hex code = rgb(red, green, blue)  (ex. #5fes32)
```
<p style = "color: #534b4b "></p>
```

## 2. What is 'Developer tools'?
Short cuts:) F12

 It's very useful "because it allows you to apply styles that affect an element directly on your page"
 
Not only your page,  "you can also inspect other sitesâ€™ elements and styles", so we need to get used to it
## 3. Add link
- line break
```
 <p> The br tag is the line break tag<br>
     It only exists as an opening tag.
 </p>
```
- link URL (3-2)

```
<p>Let's watch the video.</p>
<a href="http://youtube.com">youtube link.</a>
```
Just as you watch we can nest HTML elements.

Watch the example on (3-2), We can see that `<a>` tag is inside the `<p>` tag

Just like this nesting we can make express more things on a website!
## 4. CSS style.
We don't need to copy and paste the styles to all these paragraphs.

"Let's create a CSS file called style.css."

("Write this code at the end of the `<head>` tag.")
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

('Write the CSS code following the CSS rules')
```
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    color : #fefefe;
}
```
## 5. html basic structure and metadata.
We call 'body' part by page content and 'head' part by page metadata.

These two part are wraped by the `<html>` tag and there should be `<'!DOCTYPE html'>` at the top of the file.

This is because HTML is the language that keeps developing. The structure goes like this example.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My daily challenge</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
- "'title tag' means title on the tab and search engine."
## 6. VS code shortcuts and tips.
0. write (!) in html file -> Auto-generate HTML structure code.

1. Indentation = tab, (shift + tab)

2. Changing code line. : (Alt + Arrow keys)

3. Comments : (Ctrl + /)

4. Select same keys : (Ctrl + D)

5. Copy the same code in cursor : [Ctrl + Shift + Arrow(Down) key].
