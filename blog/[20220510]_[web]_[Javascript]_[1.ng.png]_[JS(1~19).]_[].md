## 1. How to Link Javascript
"JS" = Adds Dynamic effects and web applications in the browser.

1. Web applications (React)
2. Web server (Node.js)
3. mobile applications (React Native)
4. Desktop applications (Electron)

- How to link Javascript file
```js
    <script src="script.js"></script>
```

## 2. Values and Variables
- How to declare Variables
```
let firstName = 'James' // 'firstName' is a variable, 'James' is its value
console.log(firstName);
```
When we assign variables in Javascript, we usually use camlecase.

write firstcase lowercase, Othercasese Uppercase.
That means:

- Start with a lowercase letter.
- Capitalize The First Letter Of Each New Word.

‚Üí Example: ```firstNamePerson```

üìö [Reference]((https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course))

A variable is basically a box that stores a value.
## 3. Practice Assignment
1.Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign values based on your own country (population in millions).

2.Log their values to the console.

```javascript
let country = "korea";
let continent = "Asia";
let population = 50000000;

console.log(country);  //korea
console.log(continent);  // Asia
console.log(population); // 50000000
```
## 4. Data Types 
1.Number : Used for decimals and integers  

   ```javascript
   let age = 23;
   ```

2.String : Used for text  

   ```javascript
   let firstName = 'Jonas';
   ```

   A string must be enclosed in quotes ('' or "").

3.Boolean : Logic type can be true or false  

   ```javascript
   let fullAge = true;
   ```

4.Undefined : A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value yet ('empty value')  

   ```javascript
   let children;
   ```

5.Null : An explicitly assigned empty value

6.Symbol : A unique and immutable value (not commonly used for now)

7.BigInt : Used for very large integers beyond the range of Number


(BigInt and Symbol are rarely used in beginner-level JavaScript.)

(6,7 is not used that much)

+) Javascript comment is written by 
```javascript
// single-line comment  
/* multi-line comment */
```

- Special Operator 'typeof'
```javascript
console.log(typeof true)   // boolean
console.log(typeof 23)     // number 
console.log(typeof 'Git')  // string
```

- Changing the Value and Type of a Variable
```js
let JavascriptIsFun = true;
console.log(typeof JavascriptIsFun); // boolean

JavascriptIsFun = "YES!";
console.log(typeof JavascriptIsFun); // string
```

- Undefined
```js
let year;
console.log(year); // undefined
console.log(typeof year); // undefined

year = 1991;
console.log(year); // 1991
console.log(typeof year); // number
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è A Well Known Bug in JavaScript
```js
console.log(typeof null);  // object
```
> This is a known legacy bug in JavaScript. Just be aware of it for now.
## 5. let, const and var
- When we mutate a Variable let keyword is used.
It can also be used to declare empty Variables.
``` javascript
let age = 31;
let age = 30;
let name ;
```

* The const keyword creates a variable that cannot be reassigned.
``` javascript
const PI = 3.14;
```
- use constant normally, use let when the value needs change.

> Avoid using `var`! It's kept only for legacy reasons.

```javascript
var job = 'teacher';
job = 'programmer';
```
It may seem like let and var are simillar, 

but they're actually very different.(We'll learn more about this later.)

Don't declare variables using var unless absolutely necessary.

## 6. Basic Operators
> Operators allow us to transform or combine values.

1. Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, %..)
```js
const NOW = 2025;
const AGEJAMES = NOW - 1991;
const AGEKEVIN = NOW - 1994;
console.log(AGEJAMES, AGEKEVIN);  // 34, 31
console.log(AGEKEVIN * 2, AGEJAMES / 2);  // 62, 17
console.log(2 ** 3); // 8
```

> The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate strings.
```js
const FIRSTNAME = 'KIM';
const SECONDNAME = 'MINSOO'
console.log(FIRSTNAME + " " + SECONDNAME);  // KIM MINSOO
```

- Assignment operator(`=`)
```js
let x = 10 + 5;  // 15
x += 15  // x = x + 15 (This shorthand syntax also works with `*=`, `-=`, `/=`)
console.log(x);  // 25
x ++
console.log(x);  // 26
x --
console.log(x);  // 25
```

- Comparison Operators (<, >, <=, >=)
```js
console.log(AGEJAMES > AGEKEVIN);  // true
console.log(AGEJAMES < AGEKEVIN);  // false
```
## 7. Operator Precedence
```js
console.log(2 + 5 * 3);  // 17
console.log((2 + 5)* 3); // 21
```
The most important thing to remember is that parentheses `()` have the highest precedence.üìö [Reference]((http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence))

## 8. #1 Coding Challenge.
CHALLENGE #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

Your task is to write some code to help them:

Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.

Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.

Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too

TEST DATA 1: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.



üëã OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture



IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).

```js
let massMark = 78;
let heightMark = 1.69;
let massJohn = 92;
let heightJohn = 1.95;

let BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
let BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
let markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;

console.log("First Data:");
console.log("Mark BMI:", BMIMark.toFixed(2)); // how to make numbers round?
console.log("John BMI:", BMIJohn.toFixed(2));
console.log("Mark's BMI higher than John's?", markHigherBMI);
console.log('---');
massMark = 95; 
heightMark = 1.88;
massJohn = 85;
heightJohn = 1.76;

BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark); // 
BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn; 

console.log("Second Data:");
console.log("Mark BMI:", BMIMark.toFixed(2));
console.log("John BMI:", BMIJohn.toFixed(2));
console.log("Mark's BMI higher than John's?", markHigherBMI);
```
- In this course he use let instead const but i use let.(no problem) also i upgrade code!

> Acutally it can be solved by function but we didn't learn yet so..
## 9. Strings & Template Literals
```js
let firstName = 'Jonas';
let job = 'teacher';
let age = 33;

let intro = "I'm " + firstName + ", a " + job + " " + age
console.log(intro)  // I'm Jonas, a teacher 33
```
- This looks complex. Let's make it simpler.
> Now let's use a templet literal using (backtick and `${}`).
```js
let intro = `I'm ${firstName}, ${job} and my age is ${age}`;
console.log(intro)  // I'm Jonas, teacher and my age is 33
```
Backticks `` are very useful for string templates. Don‚Äôt forget to use them.
> Templete literals are also useful for multi-line strings.
```js
console.log('string with\n\
multiple\n\
lines')
```
-> Let's rewrite it using backticks. (by use backtick)
```js
console.log(`string with 
multiple 
lines.`)
```
## 10. if/else statements
* ex1)
```js
let age = 19;
const OLDENOUGH >= age;

if (OLDENOUGH) {  // (condition)
    console.log(`OOO is okay to driveüëå`);  // the code `{}` runs if condition is true
} else {  // else block runs when the condition is false.
    console.log(`ooo is not allowed to driveü§¨.)
}
```
- ex2)
```js
let birthYear = 1991;
let century;

if (birthYear < 2000) {
    century = 20;
} else {
    century = 21;
}

console.log(century);  // 20
```

CHALLENGE #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

 console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMIMark.toFixed(2)}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn.toFixed(2)})!`)
} else {
 console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn.toFixed(2)}) is higher than Mark's (${BMIMark.toFixed(2)})!`)
}
